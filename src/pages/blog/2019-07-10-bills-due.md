Just a reminder that bill payments are due today, July 10th. Penalties will be added at 10 a.m. tomorrow, July 11th. You are welcome to pay in the office during our normal hours, M-F 8-5 closed 12-1; drop the payment in the drop-box in the drive-thru after hours this evening, or pay online at www.stanfordwater.com. We do not accept payments over the phone. 



Also, a reminder that no pool or leak adjustments will be processed on payment due dates or penalty dates. You may pay in full today in order to avoid a penalty and receive a credit for your adjustment once it has been processed.

# Adjustments



Effective April 1, 2020, the City of Stanford Waterworks will allow** one **billing adjustment per year on **a leak that is located underground between the meter and the structure.** This is the only location that a leak is eligible for an adjustment. To be eligible for the adjustment, the account must have sewer service. The year will be counted from January 1 of that year to December 31 of that year. 

**Customer must also provide a copy of the plumber’s bill of statement with proof of location in order for the adjustment to be approved.** Any bills that are submitted will not be reimbursed; they are used for proof of leak only.  

* _There will no longer be any adjustments for swimming pools. _
* _No other leaks will be eligible for an adjustment._

Any adjustments will be based on an average of the most recent three months water use for that account.  Accounts seeking an adjustment should complete a Request for Adjustment Form within thirty days of the water leak with attached plumber’s bill. 

_A reminder: no adjustments will be processed on payment due dates or penalty dates._

Please call the office at (606) 365-4510 if you have any questions.

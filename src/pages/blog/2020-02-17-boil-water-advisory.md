The water line break has been fixed and water should hopefully be restored soon. 

Those under a boil water advisory are:

Vincent Drive\
Lincoln Plaza 

There are no other areas under the boil water advisory. Most water loss or low pressure was due to the water dropping out of the tank and therefore are not included in the advisory.
